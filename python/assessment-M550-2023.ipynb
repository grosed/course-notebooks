    "This is the assessment for the M550 Python Module. It counts as 30% of your overall mark for M550.\n",

    "The assessment is to be undertaken in small groups and your work should be submitted in the form of a single jupyter notebook. Your should have already been assigned a group to work in - please contact the course coordinator if you have any issues regarding this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission date for this assessment is 15/11/2023. Your jupyter notebook should be emailed directly  to [daniel grose](mailto:dan.grose@lancaster.ac.uk) by 09:00 on this date (one copy per group).\n",

    "The questions are \"exploratory\" in nature, so you are expected to reflect on what you are being asked to do and research the methods being developed. For example, in __Part 7__, you might choose to investigate what the effect of the quadrat size has on the power of the method for determining non randomness, or you might want to say something about how the likelihood of a obtaining a particular result might be quantified, and so on ....\n",
