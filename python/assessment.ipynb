    "The marks for each component of each task are shown in square brackets. In some of the tasks you have to provide descriptions, justifictions and supporting material such as charts, figures and possibly some simple analysis. In such cases some of the marks will be allocated according to how __creative__ and __novel__ your answers are. Try and make as good as use as you can of the facilities supported by Jupyter Notebooks. For example, LaTeX, markdown, charts, html etc."
