    "A number of discretionary marks (10) have been reserved for rewarding the quality of your work. You can gain these marks by, for example, providing additional markup in your notebook to support your solutions to the tasks, using appropriate charts and tables to summarise your data, providing links to external references, providing simple tests for your functions, and so on. You may also choose to use additional material in support of your notebook, for example, files containing python source code. If this is the case, these materials must also be available from your github repository. Some of the discretionary marks might also be awarded for examples of particularly \"pythonesque\" code.
