    "Initially, the course focuses on the python language. The later sessions then introduce python libraries that are particularly useful for statistics and data science. \n",

    "The material is presented using jupyter notebooks and jupyter book. You can learn more about jupyter [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach to teaching is hands on. You are expected to try as many exercises as you can. The jupyter notebooks for the course can be downloaded and extended with your own notes, examples, and ideas."
