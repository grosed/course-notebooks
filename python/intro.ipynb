    "This course is an introduction to python programming for statistics and data science. Since it is an introductory course it does not cover every aspect of the python programming system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the course focuses on data manipulation and analysis with Python. This is then followed with an overview of the main parts of the Python programming language, which is then is used to create some example \"scientific work flows\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "The material is presented using jupyter notebooks and jupyter book. You can learn more about jupyter [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach to teaching is hands on. You are expected to try as many exercises as you can. The jupyter notebooks for the course can be downloaded and extended with your own notes, examples, and ideas."
