You may already be a Python user and be familiar with a particular system, version and development environment, such as [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), [IDLE](https://realpython.com/python-idle/) , or [Atom](https://atom.io/). These systems usually install a version of python for you however, for STOR-607 (and STOR-601), we want to show you how to manage your own Python system independently. The advantage of this is that you can then be sure of which version of Python, and associated libraries, your software is dependent on. This can become very important when you want to share your work with other researchers and collaborators. To this end you will install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install and manage python interpreters and use python [venv](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) to manage different projects.\n",
