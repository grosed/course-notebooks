    "This course is an introduction to __c++__ for programmers who already have some programming experience with __Python__. This approach has been adopted for a number of reasons, but the most significant of these is that, in its most modern form, __c++__ can be written using concepts that are very similar in style and use to their counterparts as found in __python__. Note though, that this is really only possible when using a __modern__ __c++__ standard, typically __c++__ 14 or better. In this course we will be using __c++__ 17. Furthermore, to achieve a __Python__ like coding style in __c++__, the __Standard Template Library__ is required. This standard provides all of the data structures that are typically used in __python__, such as lists and dictionaries, but are not provided as (standard) part of __c++__.   "

However, because compiling (and linking) programs involves quite a lot of technical knowledge (that is nothing particularly to do with __c++__), using a __c++__ interpreter can be a good way to start learning c++. This is what we will do in the first part of the course. At the end of the course instructions for using a __c++__ compiler are provided."
