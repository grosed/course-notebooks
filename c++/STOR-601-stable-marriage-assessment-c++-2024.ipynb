Your submission should be in the form of jupyter notebooks along with any accompanying files (such as text files containg c++ source code) and made available for download via your github account. Please send details of your github repository to [daniel grose](mailto:dan.grose@lancaster.ac.uk) by 17:00 on the submission date. Alternatively, send me an invite via github - my github name is __grosed__. \n",
